## About sharkFin:
- sharkFin is a website application that allows the user to search and track stocks based on their company name! 
- The user can then add the specific stock and choose the amount of shares to add to their portfolio. The portfolio will then total up the value of your stock with the amount of shares of each stock and then add those up for a total value of portfolio. Percentage is also provided compared to starting fund.
